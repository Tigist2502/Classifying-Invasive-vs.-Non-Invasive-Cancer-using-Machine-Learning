# Classifying Invasive vs. Non-Invasive Cancer using Machine Learning

## Project Overview
This project aims to classify cancer cases into **invasive** and **non-invasive** categories using supervised and unsupervised machine learning methods in **R programming**. Multiple algorithms were implemented and compared to evaluate predictive performance and gain insights from different approaches.

## Objective
The primary goal is to build predictive models that can support **early diagnosis and clinical decision-making**, where distinguishing invasive from non-invasive cancer plays a critical role.

## Methods & Algorithms
- **Support Vector Machine (SVM):** Robust classification in high-dimensional space.  
- **Linear Discriminant Analysis (LDA):** Dimensionality reduction combined with classification.  
- **Random Forest:** Captures non-linear relationships and highlights feature importance.  
- **KMeans Clustering:** Unsupervised exploration of data structure without labels.  

## Tools & Technologies
- **R Programming**  
- Packages: `caret`, `randomForest`, `MASS`, `e1071`, `stats`, `ggplot2`  

## Results
- Compared the performance of supervised and unsupervised approaches.  
- Identified trade-offs in accuracy, interpretability, and clustering behavior.  
- Demonstrated the potential of **machine learning in healthcare analytics** and medical research.
