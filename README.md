# Classifying-Invasive-vs.-Non-Invasive-Cancer-using-Machine-Learning
This project focuses on classifying cancer cases into invasive and non-invasive categories using supervised and unsupervised machine learning methods. I implemented and compared different algorithms , Support Vector Machine , Linear Discriminant Analysis , Random Forest, and KMeans clustering ,to evaluate performance and insights from various approach.
# Objective
The main goal is to build predictive models that can assist in early diagnosis and decision-making in medical contexts, where distinguishing invasive from non-invasive cancer is critical.
# Methods Used
- SVM (Support Vector Machine): For robust classification in high-dimensional space.
- LDA (Linear Discriminant Analysis): For dimensionality reduction and classification.
- Random Forest: To capture non-linear relationships and feature importance.
- KMeans (Unsupervised): To explore clustering behavior without labels.
